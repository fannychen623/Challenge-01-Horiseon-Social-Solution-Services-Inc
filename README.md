# Module 01 Challenge
Topic assessed: HTML, CSS, and Git

## My Task

On-the-job ticket&mdash; **Refactoring** existing code/site to make it more accessible.

```
Accessible sites rank higher in search engines. 
Increased assessibility helps companies avoid litigation.
```

Adhere to the **Scout Rule**&mdash; always leave the code a little cleaner than when you found it.

```
Exceed expectations and improve the codebase for long-term sustainability. 
Check that all links are functioning correctly.
Increase the efficiency of the CSS by consolidating the selectors and properties
Organize CSS to follow the semantic structure of the HTML elements
Include comments before each element or section of the page.
```

## User Story

```
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
