## User Story

```
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```

    | search-engine-optimization | online-reputation-management | social-media-marketing | &#8594; | **content** |
    | benefit-lead | benefit-brand | benefit-cost | &#8594; | **benefit** |

* **Links**: Fixed any links that were unfunctional.
  * The link for `search-engine-optimization` in the navigation bar did not have a linked id in the corresponding section.
* **Heading Attributes**: Changed heading attribute in the footer from `<h3>` to `<h4>` to follow sequential order.

### CSS Updates
* **Comments**: Added indicative comments before selectors.
* **Order**: Ordered selectors based on the order appeared on HTML.
* **Element Selectors**: Changed applicable class selectors to element selectors.
  * Certain selectors do not need to be a class, such as: `header`, `nav`, `h1`, `h2`, and `footer` element selectors.
* **Descendant Selectors**: Renamed undescriptive descendant selectors, such as `div`, to descriptive element selectors.
  * Changed descendant selector `.header div` to element selector `nav`.
* **Unique Selectors**: Remove unnecesary element selectors and identify unique id selectors.
  * Unique selectors do not need to be descendant selectors.
  * Unique selectors can be id selectors instead of class selectors.
    * Such as `.header h1` and `.header h1 .seo` can just be `h1` and `#seo` respectively.
* **Properties**: Combine properties into applicable selectors.
  * Such as, properties under the `ul` and `ul li` selectors can be combined without affecting the page output.
* **Duplicate Selectors**: Consolidated selectors of the same style.
